The certificate of the department of nonliability for the tax or its receipt for the amount of tax therein certified shall be conclusive in such proceedings as to the liability or the payment of the tax to the extent of said certificate. In the case of a nontaxable estate, the court may consider the affidavit prepared pursuant to s.198.32(2) as evidence of the nonliability for tax.</p>
