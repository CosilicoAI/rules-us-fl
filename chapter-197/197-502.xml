              <p>A certificateholder, other than the county, who applies for a tax deed shall pay the tax collector at the time of application all amounts required for redemption or purchase of all other outstanding tax certificates, plus interest, any omitted taxes, plus interest, any delinquent taxes, plus interest, and current taxes, if due, covering the property. In addition, the certificateholder shall pay the costs required to bring the property to sale as provided in ss.197.532and197.542, including property information searches, and mailing costs, as well as the costs of resale, if applicable. If the certificateholder fails to pay the costs to bring the property to sale within 30 days after notice from the clerk, the tax collector shall cancel the tax deed application. The tax certificate on which the canceled tax deed application was based shall earn interest at the original bid rate of the tax certificate and remain inclusive of all tax years paid and costs associated with the tax deed application. Failure to pay the costs of resale, if applicable, within 30 days after notice from the clerk shall result in the clerk’s entering the land on a list entitled “lands available for taxes.”</p>
