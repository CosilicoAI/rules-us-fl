          <content>
            <p>Pursuant to s.200.065(2)(b), the property appraiser, in the name of the taxing authorities and local governing boards levying non-ad valorem assessments within his or her jurisdiction and at the expense of the county, shall prepare and deliver by first-class mail to each taxpayer to be listed on the current year’s assessment roll a notice of proposed property taxes, which notice shall contain the elements and use the format provided in the following form. Notwithstanding the provisions of s.195.022, no county officer shall use a form other than that provided herein. The Department of Revenue may adjust the spacing and placement on the form of the elements listed in this section as it considers necessary based on changes in conditions necessitated by various taxing authorities. If the elements are in the order listed, the placement of the listed columns may be varied at the discretion and expense of the property appraiser, and the property appraiser may use printing technology and devices to complete the form, the spacing, and the placement of the information in the columns. In addition, the property appraiser may not include in the mailing of the notice of ad valorem taxes and non-ad valorem assessments additional information or items unless such information or items explain a component of the notice or provide information directly related to the assessment and taxation of the property. A county officer may use a form other than that provided by the department for purposes of this part, but only if his or her office pays the related expenses and he or she obtains prior written permission from the executive director of the department; however, a county officer may not use a form the substantive content of which is at variance with the form prescribed by the department. The county officer may continue to use such an approved form until the law that specifies the form is amended or repealed or until the officer receives written disapproval from the executive director.</p>
