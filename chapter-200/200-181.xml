              <p>A county or municipality may levy voted millage at the maximum millage rate approved by referendum even if the levy would raise revenue in excess of that necessary for debt service as authorized by a vote of the electors pursuant to s. 12, Art. VII of the State Constitution. The county or municipality may use the surplus revenue for any lawful purpose solely related to the capital project for which the voted millage was approved, including operations and maintenance. For purposes of this chapter, the portion of the voted millage necessary to pay debt service must be treated as debt service millage and the excess portion must be treated as general millage. The portion treated as general millage must be included within the millage levied under the county or municipal 10-mill limitation.</p>
