              <p>The Chief Financial Officer shall ascertain, from the records of the General Land Office or other departments in Washington, D.C., the number of acres of land situated in the several counties in which the Apalachicola, Choctawhatchee, Ocala, and Osceola Forest Reserves are located, the number of acres of land of such forest reserve embraced in each of the counties in each of the reserves, and, also, the amount of money received by the United States Government from each of the reserves, respectively. The Chief Financial Officer shall apportion the money on hand to each county in each reserve, respectively and separately; such distribution shall be based upon the number of acres of land embraced in the Apalachicola Forest, Choctawhatchee Forest, Ocala Forest, and Osceola Forest, respectively, in each county and shall be further based upon the amount collected by the United States from each of such forests, so that such distribution, when made, will include for each county the amount due each county, based upon the receipts for the particular forest and the acreage in the particular county in which such forest is located. The Chief Financial Officer shall issue two warrants in each case, the sum of which shall be the amount due each of such counties from the fund. One warrant shall be payable to the county for the county general road fund, and one warrant, of equal amount, shall be payable to such county’s district school board for the district school fund.</p>
