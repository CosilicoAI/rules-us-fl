            <p>In order to implement s. 19(f), Art. III of the State Constitution, for the purpose of reviewing trust funds prior to their automatic termination pursuant to the provisions of s. 19(f)(2), Art. III of the State Constitution, the Legislature shall review all state trust funds at least once every 4 years. The schedule for such review may be included in the legislative budget instructions developed pursuant to the requirements of s.216.023. The Legislature shall review trust funds as they are identified by a classification scheme set out in the legislative budget request instructions pursuant to s.216.023consistent with the Department of Financial Services’ financial systems. When a statutorily created trust fund that was in existence on November 4, 1992, has more than one fund code in the financial systems, the Legislature may treat it as a single trust fund for the purposes of this section. The Legislature may also conduct its review concerning accounts within such trust funds.</p>
