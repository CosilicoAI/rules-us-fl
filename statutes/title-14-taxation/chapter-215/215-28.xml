              <p>All deductions so made by any such disbursing authority shall be deposited in a trust account separate and apart from the funds of the state, county, or subordinate agency.

Any interest earned on moneys in such account while awaiting the accumulation of the purchase price of the security shall be transferred to the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund as reimbursement for administrative costs incurred by the Department of Management Services under this section.</p>
