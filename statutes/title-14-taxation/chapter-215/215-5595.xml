                <p>Citizens Property Insurance Corporation has over 1.2 million policies in force, has the largest market share of any insurer writing residential property insurance in the state, and faces the threat of a catastrophic loss that must be funded by assessments against insurers and policyholders, unless otherwise funded by the state. The program has a substantial positive effect on the depopulation efforts of Citizens Property Insurance Corporation since companies participating in the program have removed over 199,000 policies from the corporation. Companies participating in the program have issued a significant number of new policies, thereby keeping an estimated 480,000 new policies out of the corporation.</p>

If an insurer applies after September 1, 2008, but before June 1, 2009, the amount of the surplus note is limited to one-half of the new capital that the insurer contributes to its surplus, except that an insurer writing only manufactured housing policies is eligible to receive a surplus note of up to $7 million. For purposes of this section, new capital must be in the form of cash or cash equivalents as specified in s.625.012(1).</p>

                <p>The insurer must commit to increase its writings of residential property insurance, including the peril of wind, and to meet a minimum writing ratio of net written premium to surplus of at least 1:1 for the first calendar year after receiving the state funds or renegotiation of the surplus note, 1.5:1 for the second calendar year, and 2:1 for the remaining term of the surplus note. Alternatively, the insurer must meet a minimum writing ratio of gross written premium to surplus of at least 3:1 for the first calendar year after receiving the state funds or renegotiation of the surplus note, 4.5:1 for the second calendar year, and 6:1 for the remaining term of the surplus note. The writing ratios shall be determined by the Office of Insurance Regulation and certified quarterly to the board. For this purpose, the term “premium” means premium for residential property insurance in this state, including the peril of wind, and “surplus” means the new capital and surplus note of the insurer. An insurer that makes an initial application after July 1, 2008, must also commit to writing at least 15 percent of its net or gross written premium for new policies, not including renewal premiums, for policies taken out of Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, during each of the first 3 years after receiving the state funds in exchange for the surplus note, which shall be determined by the Office of Insurance Regulation and certified annually to the board. The insurer must also commit to maintaining a level of surplus and reinsurance sufficient to cover in excess of its 1-in-100 year probable maximum loss, as determined by a hurricane loss model accepted by the Florida Commission on Hurricane Loss Projection Methodology, which shall be determined by the Office of Insurance Regulation and certified annually to the board.

The board may charge late fees up to 5 percent for late payments or other late remittances. Payment of principal, interest, or late fees by the insurer on the surplus note must be approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, who shall approve such payment unless the commissioner determines that such payment will substantially impair the financial condition of the insurer.

If the amount of surplus notes requested by insurers exceeds the amount of funds available, the board may prioritize insurers that are eligible and approved, with priority for funding given to insurers writing only manufactured housing policies, regardless of the date of application, based on the financial strength of the insurer, the viability of its proposed business plan for writing additional residential property insurance in the state, and the effect on competition in the residential property insurance market. Between insurers writing residential property insurance covering manufactured housing, priority shall be given to the insurer writing the highest percentage of its policies covering manufactured housing.</p>
