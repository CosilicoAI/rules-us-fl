            <p>Any person required to pay a tax imposed or administered under this chapter or to make a return who renders a return or makes a payment of a tax with intent to deceive or defraud the government and prevent the government from collecting the amount of taxes imposed or administered by this chapter, or who otherwise fails to comply with this chapter for the taxable period for which any return is made, any tax is paid, or any report is made to the department, may be required by the department to show cause at a time and place to be set by the department, after 10 days’ notice in writing requiring the production of such books, records, or papers relating to the business of such person for such tax period as the department requires. The department may require such person or his or her employees to give testimony under oath and answer interrogatories respecting the sale of communications services within this state, the failure to make a true report thereof, or failure to pay the true amount of the tax required to be paid under this chapter. If such person fails to produce such books, records, or papers or to appear and answer questions within the scope of investigation relating to matters concerning taxes to be imposed or administered under this chapter, or fails to allow his or her agents or employees to give testimony, the department may estimate any unpaid deficiencies in taxes to be assessed against such person based on whatever information is available to it and may issue a distress warrant for the collection of such taxes, interest, or penalties estimated by the department to be due and payable; and such assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. In such cases, the warrant shall be issued to the sheriff of any county in the state where such person owns or possesses any property; and the sheriff shall seize such property as is required to satisfy any such taxes, interest, or penalties and sell such property under the distress warrant in the same manner as property is permitted to be seized and sold under distress warrants issued to secure the payment of delinquent taxes. The department shall also have the right to writ of garnishment to subject any indebtedness due to the delinquent dealer by a third person in any goods, money, chattels, or effects of the delinquent dealer in the hands, possession, or control of the third person in the manner provided by law. The person whose tax return or report is being investigated may by written request to the department require that the hearing be set at a place within the judicial circuit wherein the person’s business is located or wherein such person’s books and records are kept. If there is jeopardy to the revenue and jeopardy is asserted in or with an assessment, the department shall proceed in the manner specified for jeopardy assessment in s.213.732.</p>

              <p>Whenever it is necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter, the department shall require a cash deposit, bond, or other security as a condition to a person’s obtaining or retaining a dealer’s certificate of registration under this chapter. The bond must be in such form and amount as the department deems appropriate under the particular circumstances. Any person who fails to produce such cash deposit, bond, or other security may not obtain or retain a dealer’s certificate of registration under this chapter. The Department of Legal Affairs may seek an injunction, when requested by the department, to prevent such person from doing business subject to the provisions of this chapter until the cash deposit, bond, or other security is posted with the department. Any security required to be deposited may be sold by the department at public sale if it becomes necessary to do so in order to recover any tax, interest, or penalty due. Notice of such sale may be served personally or by mail upon the person who deposited the security. Mailing the notice to the last known address appearing on the records of the department constitutes adequate service. Any proceeds of the sale exceeding the amount due under this chapter must be returned to the person who deposited the security.</p>

              <p>The department may issue subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum compelling the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, records, written materials, and electronically recorded information. Subpoenas must be issued with the written and signed approval of the executive director or his or her designee on written and sworn application by any employee of the department. The application must set forth the reason for the application, the name of the person subpoenaed, the time and place of appearance of the witness, and a description of any books, records, or electronically recorded information to be produced, together with a statement by the applicant that the department has unsuccessfully attempted other reasonable means of securing information and that the testimony of the witness or the written or electronically recorded materials sought in the subpoena are necessary for the collection of taxes, penalty, or interest or the enforcement of the taxes levied or administered under this chapter. A subpoena shall be served in the manner provided by law and by the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure and shall be returnable only during regular business hours and at least 20 calendar days after the date of service of the subpoena. Any subpoena to which this subsection applies must identify the taxpayer to whom the subpoena relates and to whom the records pertain and must provide other information to enable the person subpoenaed to locate the records required under the subpoena. The department shall give notice to the taxpayer to whom the subpoena relates within 3 days after the day on which the service of the subpoena is made. Within 14 days after service of the subpoena, the person to whom the subpoena is directed may serve written objection to the inspection or copying of any of the designated materials. If objection is made, the department may not inspect or copy the materials, except pursuant to an order of the circuit court. If an objection is made, the d</p>

Such notice must be given within 3 days after the day on which the service on the third-party recordkeeper is made, if the department can at that time identify the person to whom the records pertain.
