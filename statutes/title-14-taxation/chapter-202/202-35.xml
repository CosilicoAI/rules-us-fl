              <p>If a dealer or other person fails or refuses to make his or her records available for inspection so that an audit or examination of his or her books and records cannot be made, fails or refuses to register as a dealer, fails to make a report and pay the tax as provided by this chapter, makes a grossly incorrect report, or makes a report that is false or fraudulent, the department shall make an assessment from an estimate based upon the best information then available to it for the taxable period of retail sales of the dealer, together with any accrued interest and penalties. The department shall then proceed to collect the taxes, interest, and penalties on the basis of such assessment, which shall be considered prima facie correct; and the burden to show the contrary rests upon the dealer or other person. If the dealer fails to respond to a contact made pursuant to s.202.27(6), or if a dealer’s records are determined to be inadequate for purposes of determining whether the dealer properly allocated tax to and between local governments, the department may determine the proper allocation or reallocation based upon the best information available to the department and shall seek the agreement of the affected local governments.</p>

              <p>A dealer may not advertise or hold out to the public, in any manner, directly or indirectly, that he or she will absorb all or any part of the tax; that he or she will relieve the purchaser of the payment of all or any part of the tax; that the tax will not be added to the selling price of the property or services sold or released; or, when added, that it or any part thereof will be refunded either directly or indirectly by any method. A person who violates this subsection with respect to advertising or refund is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s.775.082or s.775.083.
