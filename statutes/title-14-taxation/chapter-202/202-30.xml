              <p>A dealer who is required to remit taxes by electronic funds transfer shall make a return in a manner that is initiated through an electronic data interchange. The department shall prescribe the acceptable method of transfer; the method, form, and content of the electronic data interchange, giving due regard to developing uniform standards for formats as adopted by the American National Standards Institute; the circumstances under which an electronic data interchange will serve as a substitute for the filing of another form of return; and the means, if any, by which taxpayers will be provided with acknowledgments. The department must accept such returns as timely if initiated and accepted on or before the 20th day of the month. If the 20th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or state legal holiday, returns are timely if initiated and accepted on the next succeeding workday.</p>
