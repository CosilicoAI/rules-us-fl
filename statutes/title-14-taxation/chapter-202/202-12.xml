              <p>A dealer of taxable communications services shall bill, collect, and remit the taxes on communications services imposed pursuant to chapter 203 and this section at a combined rate that is the sum of the rate of tax on communications services prescribed in chapter 203 and the applicable rate of tax prescribed in this section. However, a dealer shall, in reporting each remittance to the department, identify the portion thereof which consists of taxes remitted pursuant to chapter 203. Return forms prescribed by the department shall facilitate such reporting.</p>

              <p>Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the combined amount of taxes imposed under this section and s.203.01(1)(a)2. shall not exceed $100,000 per calendar year on charges to any person for interstate communications services that originate outside this state and terminate within this state. This subsection applies only to holders of a direct-pay permit issued under this subsection. A refund may not be given for taxes paid before receiving a direct-pay permit. Upon application, the department may issue one direct-pay permit to the purchaser of communications services authorizing such purchaser to pay the Florida communications services tax on such services directly to the department if the majority of such services used by such person are for communications originating outside of this state and terminating in this state. Only one direct-pay permit shall be issued to a person. Such direct-pay permit shall identify the taxes and service addresses to which it applies. Any dealer of communications services furnishing communications services to the holder of a valid direct-pay permit is relieved of the obligation to collect and remit the taxes imposed under this section and s.203.01(1)(a)2. on such services. Tax payments and returns pursuant to a direct-pay permit shall be monthly. As used in this subsection, “person” means a single legal entity and does not mean a group or combination of affiliated entities or entities controlled by one person or group of persons.</p>
