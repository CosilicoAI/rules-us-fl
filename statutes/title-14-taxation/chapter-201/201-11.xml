              <p>The county comptroller or, if there be none, then the clerk of the circuit court, shall serve ex officio, and the Department of Revenue may appoint others, as agents for the collection of the tax imposed by this chapter. The department may adopt rules and regulations requiring the agents to meet certain standards, including, without limitation, a demonstrated volume of business or a geographical distribution. All agents shall be subject to audit and shall post a bond as may be required by the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue may purchase a blanket bond; however, all costs associated with such a bond shall be allocated by department regulation to those agents so bonded. An agent shall be compensated 0.5 percent of the tax collected as collection costs in the form of a deduction from the amount of the tax due and remitted by the agent, and the department shall allow the said deduction to the agent paying and remitting the tax in the manner as provided for by the department. However, no deduction or allowance shall be granted when there is a manifest failure to maintain proper records or make proper reports.</p>
