          <content>
            <p>When a board of county commissioners finds that the United States, or any duly constituted agency thereof, has acquired by purchase or contract to purchase any lands in that county for reforestation, game preserve, or military aviation purposes, or that any duly constituted authority of the state has acquired lands for public road or aeronautical purposes, against which lands there is an outstanding tax lien held by the county, the board shall by resolution describe the lands acquired, the nature of the lien thereon, and the purpose for which the lands are to be used and request the department for authority to cancel the lien against the lands. A certified copy of the resolution shall be furnished to the department, and, upon receipt of the authority from the department to cancel the tax lien, the tax collector and the clerk of the county in which the lands are located shall record the authority in the official records of the county and shall note on the proper tax records of the office the action taken by the board of county commissioners and the department by noting: “Canceled by authority of s.197.447, Florida Statutes,” the date of the authority, and reference to the book number and page number where the authorization is recorded. All such taxes and liens held by the county shall thereafter be canceled. No charge shall be made for costs or expenses to secure cancellation of any tax lien affected by the provisions of this section.</p>
