          <content>
            <p>The tax collector of each county shall have the power, in the same manner and under the rules of law governing attachments of debts in other cases, to attach for taxes any tangible personal property that has been assessed at any time before payment if he or she has reason to believe that the property is being removed or disposed of so as to prevent or endanger the payment of taxes thereon. All taxes assessed upon tangible personal property shall have all the force of a judgment and execution at law against the owner of the property from the date the taxes became due. If the property is still located within the county, the tax collector may issue a warrant authorizing the tax collector, the tax collector’s deputy, or the sheriff to collect the taxes or otherwise seize the property, and the tax collector, deputy, or sheriff shall proceed in the same manner as on an execution from the circuit court. If the property is located outside the county, the tax collector may issue a warrant authorizing the sheriff of the county where the property is located to collect the taxes, or otherwise seize the property in the same manner as property in the county where the property is assessed. Thereafter, the tax collector shall proceed pursuant to s.197.413.</p>
