            <p>Within 10 days after a payment for taxes received by the tax collector is dishonored, the tax collector shall notify the payor that the payment has been dishonored.

                <p>The tax certificate sale has been adjourned, the tax collector shall readvertise the tax certificate to be resold. If the bidder’s deposit is forfeited and the certificate is readvertised, the deposit shall be used to pay the advertising fees before other costs or charges are imposed. Any portion of the bidder’s forfeit deposit that remains after advertising and other costs or charges have been paid shall be deposited by the tax collector into his or her official office account. If the tax collector fails to require a deposit and tax certificates are resold, the advertising charges required for the second sale may not be added to the face value of the tax certificate.</p>
