                <p>Except as otherwise provided, any person who manufactures, produces, compounds, processes, or fabricates in any manner tangible personal property for his or her own use shall pay a tax upon the cost of the product manufactured, produced, compounded, processed, or fabricated without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of material used, labor or service costs, or transportation charges, notwithstanding the provisions of s.212.02defining “cost price.” However, the tax levied under this paragraph shall not be imposed upon any person who manufactures or produces electrical power or energy, steam energy, or other energy at a single location, when such power or energy is used directly and exclusively at such location, or at other locations if the energy is transferred through facilities of the owner in the operation of machinery or equipment that is used to manufacture, process, compound, produce, fabricate, or prepare for shipment tangible personal property for sale or to operate pollution control equipment, maintenance equipment, or monitoring or control equipment used in such operations. The manufacture or production of electrical power or energy that is used for space heating, lighting, office equipment, or air-conditioning or any other, nonprocessing, noncompounding, nonproducing, nonfabricating, or nonshipping activity is taxable. Electrical power or energy consumed or dissipated in the transmission or distribution of electrical power or energy for resale is also not taxable. Fabrication labor shall not be taxable when a person is using his or her own equipment and personnel, for his or her own account, as a producer, subproducer, or coproducer of a qualified motion picture. For purposes of this chapter, the term “qualified motion picture” means all or any part of a series of related images, either on film, tape, or other embodiment, including, but not limited to, all items comprising part of the original work and film-related products derived therefrom as</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b), the use tax on asphalt manufactured for one’s own use shall be calculated with respect to paragraph (b) only upon the cost of materials which become a component part or which are an ingredient of the finished asphalt and upon the cost of the transportation of such components and ingredients. In addition, an indexed tax of 38 cents per ton of such manufactured asphalt shall be due at the same time and in the same manner as taxes due pursuant to paragraph (b). The indexed tax shall be adjusted each July 1 to an amount, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product of 38 cents multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the annual average of the “materials and components for construction” series of the producer price index, as calculated and published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics, for the previous calendar year, and the denominator of which is the annual average of said series for calendar year 1988.</p>

                <p>For purposes of paragraph (b), the department may establish a cost price amount for industry groups that manufacture, produce, compound, process, or fabricate tangible personal property for their own use in the performance of contracts for improvements to real property. Such cost price amount must be established as a percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the total contract price charged for the improvement. The cost price percentages established must be adopted by rule pursuant to the procedures provided in s.120.54, upon petition of a majority of the members of an industry group or by a statewide association that represents such industry group, and must be based on a reasonable estimate of average costs incurred by members of the petitioning industry group. The department is required to adopt a cost price percentage only if sufficient information is available to determine such percentage. The information considered by the department to establish the cost price percentage must be that set forth in the petition or that which is otherwise made available to the department. Any cost price percentage so established must be available only by election of a member of the industry group for which the percentage was established and may apply only to such periods or contracts for which the election is made. The election must be made by the taxpayer by timely accruing and remitting tax on the contract using the established percentage figure. If the taxpayer does not timely accrue and remit the use tax due for a contract using the percentage figure, the taxpayer may not later use this method of calculating the use tax due for that contract. Taxpayers must maintain adequate records showing the accrual of tax using the percentage figure on total contract price. Any cost price so established must remain available for use for a period of at least 5 years from the date of its adoption and must be reviewed and be subject to adjustment by the department no more frequently</p>
