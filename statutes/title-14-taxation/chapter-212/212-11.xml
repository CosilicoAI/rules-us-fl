Any dealer who operates two or more places of business for which returns are required to be filed with the department and maintains records for such places of business in a central office or place shall have the privilege on each reporting date of filing a consolidated return for all such places of business in lieu of separate returns for each such place of business; however, such consolidated returns must clearly indicate the amounts collected within each county of the state. Any dealer who files a consolidated return shall calculate his or her estimated tax liability for each county by the same method the dealer uses to calculate his or her estimated tax liability on the consolidated return as a whole. Each dealer shall file a return for each tax period even though no tax is due for such period.</p>

To qualify, a dealer must apply annually to the department prior to October 1, and, if qualified, the department must grant the application for payment of estimated sales tax pursuant to this paragraph for the following calendar year. In lieu of the method for calculating estimated sales tax liability pursuant to subparagraph (1)(a)3., a qualified dealer must calculate that option as 60 percent of the average tax liability pursuant to this chapter for all sales excluding the sale of each boat, motor vehicle, or aircraft with a sales price of $200,000 or greater during the state fiscal year ending the year in which the application is made. A qualified dealer must also remit the sales tax for each sale of a boat, motor vehicle, or aircraft with a sales price of $200,000 or greater by either electronic funds transfer on the date of the sale or on a form prescribed by the department and postmarked on the date of the sale.</p>
