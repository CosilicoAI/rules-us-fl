              <p>All third party settlement organizations that conduct transactions involving a participating payee with an address in this state and that have a contractual obligation with such participating payee to make payment to the organizations shall create a mechanism for senders of payments to identify whether a payment to a payee is for goods and services or is personal. The mechanism must clearly indicate the sender’s requirement to indicate the appropriate transaction type. The sender of the payment is responsible for indicating the appropriate transaction type. All third party settlement organizations shall maintain records that clearly identify whether a transaction, as designated by the sender of the payment, is a transaction for goods and services or is personal. The information in the return submitted to the department under subsection (2) for such entities must be limited to transactions for goods and services.</p>
