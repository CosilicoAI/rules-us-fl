            <p>For the protection of the revenue of this state, to prevent the illegal importation of tangible personal property which is subject to tax in this state, and to strengthen and make more effective the manner and method of enforcing payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, the department is hereby authorized and empowered to put into operation a system of permits whereby any person or dealer as defined in this chapter may import tangible personal property by truck, automobile, or other means of transportation other than a common carrier, without having said truck, automobile, or other means of transportation, seized and subjected to legal proceedings for its forfeiture. Such system of permits shall require the person or dealer who desires to import tangible personal property into this state, which property is subject to tax imposed by this chapter, to apply to the department or its designated agent for a certificate of registration and a permit stating the kind of vehicle used, the name of the driver, the license number of the vehicle, the kind or character of tangible personal property to be imported, the date, the name and address of the consignee and such other information as the department may deem necessary to prevent the illegal transportation of tangible personal property into this state. Such certificate of registration and permit shall be free of cost to the applicant and forms for such certificate of registration and permit may be obtained from the department or its designated agents.</p>

              <p>The importation into this state of tangible personal property which is subject to tax, by truck, automobile, or other means of transportation other than a common carrier without having first obtained a certificate of registration and permit as hereinabove described (if the tax imposed by this chapter on the said tangible personal property has not been paid), shall be construed as an attempt to evade payment of the said tax and the same is hereby prohibited and the said truck, automobile, or other means of transportation, other than that of common carrier, and said taxable property may be seized by the department in order to secure the same as evidence in a trial and the same shall be subject to forfeiture and sale in the manner provided for in this chapter. No certificate of registration or permit shall be required to transport personal effects of a driver, owner, or passengers of any private automobile or carrier vehicle not engaged in carrying goods for resale within the state. The department may issue a certificate of registration and permit to a person who is regularly or frequently importing into this state tangible personal property in trucks owned by him or her in connection with the person’s own business, requiring that reports, copies of sales documents, and other information may be filed at regular or frequent intervals with the department after importation of tangible personal property subject to the tax, and the department may require as a condition for the issuance of such certificate of registration and permit that such person post a bond payable to the department in an amount sufficient to guarantee payment of the tax on such goods as may be imported by such person, which amount the department shall set.</p>
