            <p>All business tax receipts shall be sold by the appropriate tax collector beginning July 1 of each year, are due and payable on or before September 30 of each year, and expire on September 30 of the succeeding year. If September 30 falls on a weekend or holiday, the tax is due and payable on or before the first working day following September 30. Provisions for partial receipts may be made in the resolution or ordinance authorizing such receipts. Receipts that are not renewed when due and payable are delinquent and subject to a delinquency penalty of 10 percent for the month of October, plus an additional 5 percent penalty for each subsequent month of delinquency until paid. However, the total delinquency penalty may not exceed 25 percent of the business tax for the delinquent establishment.</p>
