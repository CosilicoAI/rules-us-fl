                <p>Each unit of state or local government responsible for administering one or more of the provisions specified in subparagraphs 1.-8. is a level-one participant.

When a disclosure made under this paragraph involves confidential information provided to the participant by the Department of Revenue, the participant who provides the information shall maintain records of the disclosures, which records shall be subject to review by the Department of Revenue for a period of 5 years after the date of the disclosure.</p>

              <p>A provision of law imposing confidentiality upon data shared under this section, including, but not limited to, a provision imposing penalties for disclosure, applies to recipients of this data and their employees. Data exchanged under this section may not be provided to a person or entity other than a person or entity administering the tax or licensing provisions of those provisions enumerated in paragraph (4)(a), and such data may not be used for any purpose other than for enforcing those tax or licensing provisions. This2subsection does not prevent a level-two participant from publishing statistics classified so as to prevent the identification of particular accounts, reports, declarations, or returns. However, statistics may not be published if they contain data pertaining to fewer than three taxpayers or if the statistics are prepared for geographic areas below the county level and contain data pertaining to fewer than 10 taxpayers. This subsection does not authorize the publishing of statistics that could be used to calculate the gross receipts or income of any individual taxpayer. Statistics may not be published under this section if a single taxpayer has remitted more than 33 percent of the tax that is the subject of the statistics. Statistics published under this subsection must relate only to tourist development taxes imposed under s.125.0104, the tourist impact tax imposed under s.125.0108, convention development taxes imposed under s.212.0305, or the municipal resort tax authorized under chapter 67-930, Laws of Florida. This subsection does not prevent the Department of Revenue from meeting the requirements of s.125.0104(3)(h).</p>
