          <content>
            <p>A tax is imposed upon the transfer of real property situate and tangible personal property having an actual situs in this state and upon intangible personal property physically present within this state of every person who at the time of death was not a resident of the United States, the amount of which shall be a sum equal to such proportion of the credit allowable under the applicable federal revenue act for estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes actually paid to the several states, as the value of the property taxable in this state bears to the value of the estate taxable by the United States wherever situate. For the purpose of this section, stock in a corporation organized under the laws of this state shall be deemed physically present within this state. The amount receivable as insurance upon the life of a decedent who at the time of death was not a resident of the United States, and any moneys deposited with any person carrying on the banking business by or for such decedent who was not engaged in business in the United States at the time of death, shall not, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be physically present in this state.</p>
