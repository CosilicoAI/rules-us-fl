            <p>Upon the request of the Department of Transportation, the Division of Bond Finance is authorized pursuant to s. 11, Art. VII of the State Constitution and the State Bond Act to issue revenue bonds, for and on behalf of the Department of Transportation, for the purpose of financing or refinancing the construction, reconstruction, and improvement of projects that are eligible to receive assistance from the state-funded infrastructure bank as provided in s.339.55. The facilities to be financed with the proceeds of such bonds are designated as state fixed capital outlay projects for the purposes of s. 11(d), Art. VII of the State Constitution, and the specific facilities to be financed shall be determined by the Department of Transportation in accordance with s.339.55. Each project financed with the proceeds of the bonds issued under this section in the 2003-2004 fiscal year is approved as required by s. 11(f), Art. VII of the State Constitution. In the 2004-2005 fiscal year and thereafter, legislative approval of the department’s tentative work program specifying the State Infrastructure Bank project loans constitutes approval to issue bonds as required by s. 11(f), Art. VII of the State Constitution. The Division of Bond Finance is authorized to consider innovative financing techniques, which may include, but are not limited to, innovative bidding and structures of potential financings that may result in negotiated transactions.</p>
