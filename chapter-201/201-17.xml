In no event shall the penalty be less than $10 for failure to timely file a tax return required. If it is determined by clear and convincing evidence that any part of a deficiency is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax as a civil penalty, in lieu of the aforementioned penalty under this paragraph, an amount equal to 200 percent of the deficiency. These penalties are to be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other penalties imposed by law.</p>
