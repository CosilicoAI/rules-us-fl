                <p>On mortgages, trust deeds, security agreements, or other evidences of indebtedness filed or recorded in this state, and for each renewal of the same, the tax shall be 35 cents on each $100 or fraction thereof of the indebtedness or obligation evidenced thereby. Mortgages, including, but not limited to, mortgages executed without the state and recorded in the state, which incorporate the certificate of indebtedness, not otherwise shown in separate instruments, are subject to the same tax at the same rate. When there is both a mortgage, trust deed, or security agreement and a note, certificate of indebtedness, or obligation, the tax shall be paid on the mortgage, trust deed, or security agreement at the time of recordation. A notation shall be made on the note, certificate of indebtedness, or obligation that the tax has been paid on the mortgage, trust deed, or security agreement. If a mortgage, trust deed, security agreement, or other evidence of indebtedness is subsequently filed or recorded in this state to evidence an indebtedness or obligation upon which tax was paid under paragraph (a) or subsection (2), tax shall be paid on the mortgage, trust deed, security agreement, or other evidence of indebtedness on the amount of the indebtedness or obligation evidenced which exceeds the aggregate amount upon which tax was previously paid under this paragraph and under paragraph (a) or subsection (2). If the mortgage, trust deed, security agreement, or other evidence of indebtedness subject to the tax levied by this section secures future advances, as provided in s.697.04, the tax shall be paid at the time of recordation on the initial debt or obligation secured, excluding future advances; at the time and so often as any future advance is made, the tax shall be paid on all sums then advanced regardless of where such advance is made.

The obligor and mortgagor must be the same as on the prior note or mortgage, and there may not be new or additional obligors or mortgagors.

In order to qualify for the tax treatment provided for in this subsection, the document which evidences the increase in indebtedness must show the official records book and page number in which, and the county in which, the original obligation and any prior increase in that obligation were recorded.</p>

Modifications to documents which do not modify the terms of the indebtedness evidenced such as those given or recorded to correct error; modify covenants, conditions, or terms unrelated to the debt; sever a lien into separate liens; provide for additional, substitute, or further security for the indebtedness; consolidate indebtedness or collateral; add, change, or delete guarantors; or which substitute a new mortgagee or payee are not renewals and are not subject to tax pursuant to this section. A modification of an original document which changes only the interest rate and is made as the result of the discontinuation of an index to which the original interest rate is referenced is not a renewal and is not subject to the tax pursuant to this section. If the taxable amount of a mortgage is limited by language contained in the mortgage or by the application of rules limiting the tax base when there is collateral in more than one state, then a modification which changes such limitation or tax base shall be taxable only to the extent of any increase in the limitation or tax base attributable to such modification. This subsection shall not be interpreted to exempt from taxation an original mortgage that would otherwise be subject to tax pursuant to paragraph (1)(b).</p>

The maximum claim amount and the stated mortgage amount are not subject to the tax imposed in this section. As used in this subsection, the term “principal limit” means the gross amount of loan proceeds available to the borrower without consideration of any use restrictions. For purposes of this subsection, the tax must be calculated based on the principal limit amount determined at the time of closing as evidenced by the recorded mortgage or any supporting documents attached thereto.</p>
