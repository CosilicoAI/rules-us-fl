The owner or lessee of any property used to house a charter school pursuant to s.196.1983who is not required to file an annual application shall notify the property appraiser promptly whenever the use of the property or the status or condition of the owner or lessee changes so as to change the exempt status of the property.

The property appraiser making such determination shall record in the public records of the county a notice of tax lien against any property owned by that person or entity in the county, and such property must be identified in the notice of tax lien. Such property is subject to the payment of all taxes and penalties. Such lien when filed shall attach to any property, identified in the notice of tax lien, owned by the person or entity who illegally or improperly received the exemption. If such person or entity no longer owns property in that county but owns property in some other county or counties in the state, the property appraiser shall record a notice of tax lien in such other county or counties, identifying the property owned by such person or entity in such county or counties, and it shall become a lien against such property in such county or counties.</p>

Such petition must be filed during the taxable year on or before the 25th day following the mailing of the notice by the property appraiser as provided in s.194.011(1).

Notwithstanding such waiver, refiling of an application or statement shall be required when any property granted an exemption is sold or otherwise disposed of, when the ownership changes in any manner, when the applicant for homestead exemption ceases to use the property as his or her homestead, or when the status of the owner changes so as to change the exempt status of the property. In its deliberations on whether to waive the annual application or statement requirement, the governing body shall consider the possibility of fraudulent exemption claims which may occur due to the waiver of the annual application requirement.
