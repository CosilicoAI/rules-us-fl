            <p>The authority of a public body to require taxes, fees, charges, or other impositions from dealers of communications services for occupying its roads and rights-of-way is specifically preempted by the state because of unique circumstances applicable to communications services dealers. Communications services may be provided by certain dealers of communications services in a manner that requires the use of public roads or rights-of-way while similar communications services may be provided by other dealers of communications services in a manner that does not require the use of public roads or rights-of-way. Although similar communications services may be provided by different means, the state seeks to treat dealers of communications services in a nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral manner.</p>
