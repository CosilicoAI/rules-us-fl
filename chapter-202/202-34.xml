            <p>Each dealer shall secure, maintain, and keep as long as required by s.213.35a complete record of communications services sold at retail by the dealer, together with invoices, records of gross receipts from such sales, and other pertinent records and papers required by the department for the reasonable administration of this chapter. All such records that are located or maintained in this state must be made available for inspection by the department at all reasonable hours at the dealer’s office or other place of business located in this state. Any dealer who maintains such books and records outside this state must make such books and records available for inspection by the department wherever the dealer’s general records are kept. Any dealer subject to the provisions of this chapter who violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s.775.082or s.775.083. If, however, any subsequent offense involves intentional destruction of such records with an intent to evade payment of or deprive the government of any tax revenues, such subsequent offense constitutes a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s.775.082or s.775.083.</p>

                <p>For the purpose of this subsection, if a dealer does not have adequate records of its sales of communications services, the department may, upon the basis of a test or sampling of the dealer’s available records or other information relating to the sales made by such dealer for a representative period, determine the proper basis for assessing tax. This subsection does not affect the duty of the dealer to collect, or the liability of any consumer to pay, any tax imposed or administered under this chapter.</p>

                <p>If the records of a dealer are adequate but voluminous, the department may reasonably sample such records and project the audit findings derived therefrom over the entire audit period to determine the proper basis for assessing tax. In order to conduct such a sample, the department must first make a good faith effort to reach an agreement with the dealer which provides for the means and methods to be used in the sampling process. If an agreement is not reached, the dealer is entitled to a review by the executive director or the executive director’s designee of the sampling method to be used by the auditor.</p>

                <p>Once the notification required by paragraph (a) is issued, the department, at any time, may respond to contact initiated by a taxpayer to discuss the audit, and the taxpayer may provide records or other information, electronically or otherwise, to the department. The department may examine, at any time, documentation and other information voluntarily provided by the taxpayer, its representative, or other parties; information already in the department’s possession; or publicly available information. Examination by the department of such information does not commence an audit if the review takes place within 60 days after the notice of intent to conduct an audit. The requirement in paragraph (a) does not prohibit the department from making initial contact with the taxpayer to confirm receipt of the notification or to confirm the date that the audit will begin. If the taxpayer has not previously waived the 60-day notice period and believes the department commenced the audit before the 61st day, the taxpayer must object in writing to the department before the issuance of an assessment or the objection is waived. If the objection is not waived and it is determined during a formal or informal protest that the audit was commenced before the 61st day after the issuance of the notice of intent to audit, the tolling period provided for in s.213.345shall be considered lifted for the number1of days equal to the difference between the date the audit commenced and the 61st day after the date of the department’s notice of intent to audit.</p>
