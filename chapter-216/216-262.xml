The additions or deletions must be consistent with the intent of the approved operating budget, must be consistent with legislative policy and intent, and must not conflict with specific spending policies specified in the General Appropriations Act.</p>

                <p>Perquisites may not be furnished by a state agency or by the judicial branch unless approved by the Department of Management Services, or otherwise delegated to the agency head, or by the Chief Justice, respectively, during each fiscal year. Whenever a state agency or the judicial branch is to furnish perquisites, the Department of Management Services or the agency head to which the approval has been delegated or the Chief Justice, respectively, must approve the kind and monetary value of such perquisites before they may be furnished. Perquisites may be furnished only when in the best interest of the state due to the exceptional or unique requirements of the position. The value of a perquisite may not be used to compute an employee’s base rate of pay or regular rate of pay unless required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. Permissible perquisites include, but are not limited to, moving expenses, clothing, use of vehicles and other transportation, domestic services, groundskeeping services, telephone services, medical services, housing, utilities, and meals. The Department of Management Services may adopt uniform rules applicable to the executive branch agencies to implement its responsibilities under this paragraph, which rules may specify additional perquisites, establish additional criteria for each kind of perquisite, provide the procedure to be used by executive agencies in applying for approvals, and establish the required justification. As used in this section, the term “perquisites” means those things, or the use thereof, or services of a kind that confer on the officers or employees receiving them some benefit that is in the nature of additional compensation, or that reduce to some extent the normal personal expenses of the officer or employee receiving them. The term includes, but is not limited to, such things as quarters, subsistence, utilities, laundry services, medical service, use of state-owned vehicles for other than state purposes, and servants paid b</p>

                <p>If goods and services are to be sold to officers and employees of a state agency or of the judicial branch rather than being furnished as perquisites, the kind and selling price thereof shall be approved by the Department of Management Services, unless otherwise delegated to the agency head, or by the Chief Justice, respectively, during each fiscal year before such sales are made. The selling price may be deducted from any amounts due by the state to any person receiving such things. The amount of cash so deducted shall be faithfully accounted for. This paragraph does not apply to sales to officers or employees of items generally sold to the public and does not apply to meals which may be provided without charge to volunteers under a volunteer service program approved by the Department of Management Services. The goods and services may include, but are not limited to, medical services, long-term and short-term rental housing, and laundry and transportation services. The Department of Management Services may adopt uniform rules applicable to the executive branch agencies to implement its responsibilities under this paragraph, which rules may specify other items that may be approved, the required justification for proposed sales, and the manner in which agencies will apply for approvals.</p>

              <p>The provisions of paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) do not apply to an individual filling a position the salary of which has been specifically fixed or limited by law. Unless specifically authorized by law, an individual filling or performing the duties of a position the salary of which has been specifically fixed or limited by law may not receive compensation from more than one appropriation, or in excess of the amount so fixed or limited by law, regardless of any additional duties performed by that individual in any capacity or position. However, this subsection does not prohibit additional compensation from an educational appropriation to any person holding a position the salary of which is specifically fixed or limited by law, provided such compensation does not exceed payment for more than one course of instruction during any one academic term and that such compensation is approved as provided in paragraphs (1)(d) and (e). Any compensation received by any person pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall not be computed as a part of average final compensation for retirement purposes under the provisions of chapter 121.</p>
