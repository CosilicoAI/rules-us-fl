            <p>The Department of Management Services shall develop and maintain an automated inventory of all facilities owned, leased, rented, or otherwise occupied or maintained by a state agency, the judicial branch, or the water management districts. The inventory data shall be provided annually by July 1 by the owning or operating agency in a format prescribed by the department and must include the location, occupying agency, ownership, size, condition assessment, valuations, operating costs, maintenance record, age, parking and employee facilities, building uses, full-time equivalent occupancy, known restrictions or historic designations, leases or subleases, associated revenues, and other information as required by rule adopted by the department. The department shall use this data for determining maintenance needs, conducting strategic analyses, including, but not limited to, analyzing and identifying candidates for surplus, valuation, and disposition, and life-cycle cost evaluations of the facility. The inventory need not include a condition assessment or maintenance record of facilities not owned by a state agency, the judicial branch, or a water management district. The term “facility,” as used in this section, means buildings, structures, and building systems, but does not include transportation facilities of the state transportation system.</p>
