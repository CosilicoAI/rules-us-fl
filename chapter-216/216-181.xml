Any agreement that provides for advancements may contain a clause that permits the contractor or recipient to temporarily invest the proceeds, provided that any interest income shall either be returned to the agency or be applied against the agency’s obligation to pay the contract amount. This paragraph does not constitute lawful authority to make any advance payment not otherwise authorized by laws relating to a particular agency or general laws relating to the expenditure or disbursement of public funds. The Chief Financial Officer may, after consultation with the legislative appropriations committees, advance funds beyond a 3-month requirement if it is determined to be consistent with the intent of the approved operating budget.</p>
