          <heading>Court settlement funds negotiated by the state.</heading>
          <content>
            <p>In any court settlement in which a state agency or officer or any other counsel representing the interests of the state negotiates settlement amounts to be expended by the judicial branch or the executive branch, such funds may not be expended unless the Legislature has appropriated funds to the agency in the appropriate category or the Legislative Budget Commission has approved a budget amendment for such funds. In either instance, the funding source identified must be sufficient to cover both the anticipated program costs and the amount of the settlement, the settlement must not be contrary to the intent of the Legislature, and, if the settlement amount is substantial, good reason must exist for entering into the settlement prior to the next legislative session and no significant amount of recurring funding shall be committed. When a state agency or officer settles an action in which the state will receive moneys, the funds shall be placed in the General Revenue Fund or in the trust fund that is associated with the agency’s or officer’s authority to pursue the legal action. The provisions of this section are subject to the notice and review procedures set forth in s.216.177.</p>
