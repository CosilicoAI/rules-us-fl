              <p>The department shall issue to the taxpayer, with any jeopardy assessment, a notice or finding of the facts which constitute a jeopardy to the revenue. A warrant, lien, or other detainer of property may be issued and recorded as provided by law simultaneously with the issuance of a jeopardy assessment. Such warrant, lien, or detainer may proceed to execution, levy, and seizure as provided by law. However, the department shall not hold an execution sale or other sale of the property without order of a court of competent jurisdiction until the expiration of the time provided in s.72.011for filing an action in circuit court or petition for administrative proceeding or, if such an action or petition is filed, until the decision rendered in such action or proceeding is final.</p>

Upon request of the taxpayer, the department shall meet with the taxpayer at a time set by the department within 10 days after the issuance of the assessment.</p>

              <p>If the department proceeds to seize or freeze the assets of a taxpayer upon a determination of jeopardy, the taxpayer shall have a right to a meeting with the department, as provided by subsection (3), immediately or within 24 hours after requesting such meeting. The department shall, within 24 hours after such meeting, determine whether to release the seizure or freeze. If the department does not release such seizure or freeze of property, the taxpayer shall have a right to request a hearing within 5 days before the circuit court, at which hearing the taxpayer and the department may present evidence with respect to the issue of jeopardy. Venue in such an action shall lie in the county in which the seizure was effected or, if there are multiple seizures based upon the same assessment, venue shall also lie in Leon County. Whenever an action is filed to seek review of a jeopardy finding under this subsection, the court shall set an immediate hearing and shall give the case priority over other pending cases other than those filed pursuant to s.119.11.</p>
