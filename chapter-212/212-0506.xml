              <p>For exercising such privilege, a tax is levied on each taxable transaction or incident, which tax is due and payable at the rate of 6 percent on the total consideration received or to be received by any person for issuing and delivering any service warranty.</p>

              <p>For purposes of this section, “service warranty” means any contract or agreement which indemnifies the holder of the contract or agreement for the cost of maintaining, repairing, or replacing tangible personal property. The term “service warranty” does not include contracts or agreements to repair, maintain, or replace tangible personal property if such property when sold at retail in this state would not be subject to the tax imposed by this chapter or if the parts and labor to repair tangible personal property qualify for an exemption under this chapter, nor does it include such contracts or agreements covering tangible personal property which becomes a part of real property.</p>

Such person shall remit the tax to the department at the times and in the manner provided for dealers to remit taxes on tangible personal property under this chapter.</p>

              <p>If a transaction involves both the issuance of a service warranty that is subject to such tax and the issuance of a warranty, guaranty, extended warranty or extended guaranty, contract, agreement, or other written promise that is not subject to such tax, the consideration shall be separately identified and stated with respect to the taxable and nontaxable portions of the transaction. If the consideration is separately apportioned and identified in good faith, such tax shall apply to the transaction to the extent that the consideration received or to be received in connection with the transaction is payment for a service warranty subject to such tax. If the consideration is not apportioned in good faith, the department may reform the contract; such reformation by the department is to be considered prima facie correct, and the burden to show the contrary rests upon the dealer. If the consideration for such a transaction is not separately identified and stated, the entire transaction is taxable.</p>
