In order to conduct such a sample, the department must first make a good faith effort to reach an agreement with the dealer, which agreement provides for the means and methods to be used in the sampling process. In the event that no agreement is reached, the dealer is entitled to a review by the executive director. In the case of fixed assets, a dealer may agree in writing with the department for adequate but voluminous records to be statistically sampled. Such an agreement shall provide for the methodology to be used in the statistical sampling process. The audit findings derived therefrom shall be projected over the period represented by the sample in order to determine the proportion that taxable purchases bear to total purchases. Once an agreement has been signed, it is final and conclusive with respect to the method of sampling fixed assets, and the department may not conduct a detailed audit of fixed assets, and the taxpayer may not request a detailed audit after the agreement is reached.</p>
