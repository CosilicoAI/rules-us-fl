            <p>Beginning January 1, 2022, there is allowed a credit of 100 percent of an eligible contribution made to the New Worlds Reading Initiative under s.1003.485against any tax imposed by the state and due under this chapter from a direct pay permitholder as a result of the direct pay permit held pursuant to s.212.183. For purposes of the dealer’s credit granted for keeping prescribed records, filing timely tax returns, and properly accounting and remitting taxes under s.212.12, the amount of tax due used to calculate the credit shall include any eligible contribution made to the New Worlds Reading Initiative from a direct pay permitholder. For purposes of the distributions of tax revenue under s.212.20, the department shall disregard any tax credits allowed under this section to ensure that any reduction in tax revenue received which is attributable to the tax credits results only in a reduction in distributions to the General Revenue Fund. Section1003.485applies to the credit authorized by this section. A dealer who claims a tax credit under this section must file his or her tax returns and pay his or her taxes by electronic means under s.213.755.</p>
